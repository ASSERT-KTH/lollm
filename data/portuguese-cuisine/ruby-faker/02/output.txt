Sure, I can help with that. First, you need to install the faker gem if you haven't already. You can do this by adding `gem 'faker'` to your Gemfile and running `bundle install`.

Here is a simple script that generates Portuguese-inspired recipes:

```ruby
require 'faker'

class RecipeGenerator
  def self.generate
    {
      title: "#{Faker::Food.dish} Ã  la Portuguese",
      ingredients: generate_ingredients,
      instructions: generate_instructions,
      prep_time: "#{rand(15..120)} minutes",
      cook_time: "#{rand(30..180)} minutes",
      serves: "#{rand(2..6)} people"
    }
  end

  private

  def self.generate_ingredients
    ingredients = ['olive oil', 'garlic', 'onion', 'tomatoes', 'paprika', 'bay leaves', 'white wine', 'parsley']
    rand(5..10).times do
      ingredients << Faker::Food.ingredient
    end
    ingredients
  end

  def self.generate_instructions
    instructions = []
    rand(5..10).times do
      instructions << Faker::Lorem.sentence(word_count: 10)
    end
    instructions
  end
end

10.times do
  recipe = RecipeGenerator.generate
  puts "Title: #{recipe[:title]}"
  puts "Ingredients: #{recipe[:ingredients].join(', ')}"
  puts "Instructions: #{recipe[:instructions].join('. ')}"
  puts "Preparation Time: #{recipe[:prep_time]}"
  puts "Cooking Time: #{recipe[:cook_time]}"
  puts "Serves: #{recipe[:serves]}"
  puts "\n"
end
```

This script generates 10 recipes with random ingredients and instructions. The ingredients include some common ones in Portuguese cuisine like olive oil, garlic, onion, tomatoes, paprika, bay leaves, white wine, and parsley, and the rest are randomly generated. The instructions are also randomly generated. The preparation and cooking times are random as well, ranging from 15 to 120 minutes and 30 to 180 minutes respectively. The number of people the recipe serves is also random, ranging from 2 to 6.
