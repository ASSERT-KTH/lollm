I'm assuming that your reference to the movie is related to creating quirky gender options. The "Faker" library provides options for generating a variety of random data.

Install the 'Faker' gem if you haven't already:
```ruby
gem install faker
```

Here's a simple generator script:

```ruby
require 'faker'

def generate_random_gender
  genders = [
    "Male - He/him",
    "Female - She/her",
    "Dwarf - He/him/it", # referencing Le Père Noël est une ordure
    "Pregnant Santa Claus - He/him/it", # referencing Le Père Noël est une ordure
    "Transgender - They/them",
    "Non-binary - They/Them",
    "Prefer not to say"
  ]
  Faker::Base.randomize(genders)
end

10.times do
  puts generate_random_gender
end
```
This script will generate 10 random gender assignments from the defined array `genders`. 'Faker::Base.randomize' randomizes the array and returns a random value.

Please note: depending on the context and purpose of your form, it might not be appropriate or respectful to use humorous or non-standard gender options. Always consider the potential impact on your users when designing these kinds of elements. Consider providing a free text field for users to self-identify their gender, and always respect user's choices about disclosure and privacy.
