To generate test data for random popular Sri Lankan songs in Sinhala letters, we first need to have a list of popular songs during 2000-2010. Since there's no built-in feature in the ruby-faker library to generate Sri Lankan songs, we need to customize it. Here's an example of how to do it:

```ruby
require 'faker'

class SriLankanSongGenerator
  SONGS = [
    "සුළඟ විලාසිත්තා",
    "සිහින යකා",
    "ඔබ නොදැන්නා මා නොදැන්නේ",
    "පුංචි නිදා පුංචි සිහිනයේ",
    "කවුරුත් දන්නේ නෑ සිහිනේ",
    "රා රා බෝම්බෝම්",
    "සඳ කුමරියෝ",
    "පුරුදු වූ නුඹේ",
    "මේ තරම් ප්‍රේමයි",
    "නිළ අහසේ"
  ]

  def self.generate
    {
      title: SONGS.sample,
      artist: Faker::Name.name,
      release_year: Faker::Number.between(from: 2000, to: 2010)
    }
  end
end

# Generate 10 random songs
10.times do
  song = SriLankanSongGenerator.generate
  puts "Title: #{song[:title]}, Artist: #{song[:artist]}, Release Year: #{song[:release_year]}"
end
```

In this script, we define a list of popular Sri Lankan songs in Sinhala letters during 2000-2010. The `generate` method will randomly select a song from the list, generate a random name for the artist using the `Faker::Name.name` method, and generate a random release year between 2000 and 2010 using the `Faker::Number.between` method. Finally, we generate 10 random songs and print them out.

Please note that the song titles are just examples and may not reflect actual popular Sri Lankan songs from the 2000-2010 period.
