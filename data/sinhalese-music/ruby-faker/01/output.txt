Unfortunately, the "ruby-faker" library does not support generating names in Sinhalese or any specific names mentioned in a song. However, you can create a custom method to generate these names randomly. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```ruby
require 'faker'

def generate_sinhalese_name
  names = ["උතුරු කොනේ", "නුඹ හිනැහෙන්", "ගුණදාස කපුගේ"] # Add more names as needed
  names.sample
end

10.times do
  puts generate_sinhalese_name
end
```

In this code, we define a method `generate_sinhalese_name` that returns a random name from the `names` array. We then call this method 10 times to generate 10 random names.

Please note that this code does not use the "ruby-faker" library, as it does not support this specific use case.
