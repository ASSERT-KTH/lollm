Sure, here is a simple custom test data generator in Ruby that generates wine-pairings between Portuguese wines and Portuguese foods. It uses the ruby-faker library to generate random Portuguese names for the wines and foods.

First, install the faker gem if you haven't already:

```ruby
gem install faker
```

Then, here is the code:

```ruby
require 'faker'

# List of Portuguese wines
portuguese_wines = [
  'Vinho Verde',
  'Vinho Alvarinho',
  'Vinho do Douro',
  'Vinho do Alentejo',
  'Vinho da Bairrada',
  'Vinho da Madeira',
  'Porto'
]

# List of Portuguese foods
portuguese_foods = [
  'Bacalhau a Bras',
  'Arroz de Pato',
  'Feijoada Trasmontana',
  'Alheira de Mirandela',
  'Caldo Verde',
  'Francesinha',
  'Pastel de Nata'
]

# Function to generate wine-food pairings
def generate_pairings(wines, foods)
  wines.each do |wine|
    food = foods.sample
    puts "Wine: #{wine}, Food: #{food}"
  end
end

# Generate pairings
generate_pairings(portuguese_wines, portuguese_foods)
```

This script will output a list of wine-food pairings, where each wine is paired with a random food from the list. If you want to generate different pairings, simply run the script again.

Please note that the pairings are arbitrary and may not represent actual recommended pairings between the wines and foods.
