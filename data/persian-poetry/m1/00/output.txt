Certainly! Here is a famous poem by Omar Khayyam in Farsi:

در دیر مغان گنج صفتی است می‌خور که ز دیر گنج توافتی است همنشینی خرابات گزین تا گنجروی خراباتی است

Translated into English:

In the monastery, a precious gem exists, Drink wine as you have obtained treasure from the monastery. Choose the company of the tavern, For to walk in the tavern is as if you have found a treasure.

Note: Omar Khayyam was a Persian mathematician, philosopher, and poet who lived in the 11th and 12th centuries. His poems often explore themes of love, wine, and the transient nature of life.
