Certainly! Here's a famous quatrain (rubaiyat) by the Persian poet Omar Khayyam:

گل بهار زمين به خندانی بشکفت
ز باد سحر پيراهن شب به چاک شد
بیا، که اين غزل نسيم سحرگه بود
سحر سفر نيکوست، گر می‌روی، مرو

In English, it can be roughly translated as:

"The flowers of spring have blossomed with laughter in the land,
From the morning breeze, the robe of night has been torn.
Come, for this poem is the morning breeze,
The morning is a good time to travel; if you're going, go."

Omar Khayyam's poetry often reflects themes of love, nature, and the transitory nature of life.
