Creating a Ruby Faker-style generator for Hafez poem lines requires a bit of creativity and customization. You can use the Faker gem as a base and then customize it to generate Hafez-style poetry lines. Here's a basic example with at least 5 data points:

```ruby
require 'faker'

module HafezFaker
  class << self
    def verse
      Faker::Lorem.sentence
    end

    def ghazal
      Array.new(5) { verse }.join("\n")
    end

    def rubaiyat
      Array.new(4) { verse }.join("\n") + "\n#{verse}"
    end

    def masnavi
      Array.new(8) { verse }.join("\n") + "\n#{verse}"
    end

    def quatrain
      Array.new(4) { verse }
    end
  end
end

# Example usage:
puts "Random Hafez-style Poetry Line:"
puts HafezFaker.verse

puts "\nRandom Hafez-style Ghazal (5 verses):"
puts HafezFaker.ghazal

puts "\nRandom Hafez-style Rubaiyat (4 verses):"
puts HafezFaker.rubaiyat

puts "\nRandom Hafez-style Masnavi (8 verses):"
puts HafezFaker.masnavi

puts "\nRandom Hafez-style Quatrain (4 verses):"
puts HafezFaker.quatrain.join("\n")
```

In this example:

    HafezFaker module provides methods to generate different types of Hafez-style poetry lines: verse, ghazal (5 verses), rubaiyat (4 verses), masnavi (8 verses), and quatrain (4 verses).

    The verse method generates a single line of poetry using Faker's Lorem.sentence.

    The ghazal, rubaiyat, masnavi, and quatrain methods generate longer poems by combining multiple verses.

You'll need to have the Faker gem installed to use this code. You can install it by adding gem 'faker' to your Gemfile or running gem install faker.
