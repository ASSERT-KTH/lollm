[21] >>> generate a swedish personal number for a person born in feb 29

In Sweden, personal numbers (personnummer) are based on the individual's date of birth and follow a specific format. 
However, since February 29th only occurs during leap years, the personal number for a person born on February 29th would 
have a special format.

Assuming the person was born on February 29th, 1996, during a leap year, their Swedish personal number would follow this 
format:

960229-XXXX

In this case, the first six digits represent the person's birthdate in the format YYMMDD. The last four digits (represented
by "XXXX") are usually randomly assigned numbers by the Swedish Tax Agency, and they serve to distinguish individuals born 
on the same day.

Please note that the above example assumes a random assignment for the last four digits. In reality, the actual personal 
number would be assigned by the Swedish Tax Agency according to their own conventions and regulations.
